/**
 * Cheap probe for a stalled/never-started queue worker — the app relies
 * entirely on the `database` queue (activation bonuses, payment
 * notification emails, PalmPay bank-list sync, ...), and a dead worker
 * fails completely silently: jobs just accumulate in the `jobs` table with
 * zero log output, discovered only when a user notices something never
 * arrived. Intended to be run on a schedule (e.g. every 15-30 minutes) via
 * the same external cron entry pattern documented in docs/cron-jobs.md.
